masternodeprivkey=WALLET_GENKEY
masternode=1
masternodeblsprivkey=secret_key_here
```
CTRL X to save it. Y for yes, then ENTER.

6. Restart the wallet and now the VPS is ready
```
polis-cli stop
```
```
polisd &
```

## Cold Wallet Setup Part 2 

1. On your local machine open your `masternode.conf` file.
   Depending on your operating system you will find it in:
   * Windows: `%APPDATA%\polisCore\`
   * Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/polisCore/`
   * Unix/Linux: `~/.poliscore/`
   
   Leave the file open
2. Go to "Tools" -> "Debug console"
3. Run the following command: `masternode outputs`
4. You should see output like the following if you have a transaction with exactly 1000 POLIS:
```
{
    "12345678xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx": "0"
}
```
5. The value on the left is your `txid` and the right is the `vout`
6. Add a line to the bottom of the already opened `masternode.conf` file using the IP of your
VPS (with port 24126), `private key`, `txid` and `vout`:
```
mn1 1.2.3.4:24126 3xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 12345678xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 0 
```
7. Save the file, exit your wallet and reopen your wallet.
8. Go to the "Masternodes" tab
9. Click "Start All"
10. You will see "SENTINEL_PING_EXPIRED". Just wait some time, you should see a timer start in about 30 minutes.

Done !  

Note: 15 confirmations are needed to avoid error "Failed to verify MNB".
